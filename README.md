# rustpal: A ChatGPT assistant built with Rust

I'm using this to learn Rust. It fun to build.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
cargo install
```

Get your [OpenAI] API key: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and export it as an environment variable in your shell:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Then, run the program:

```bash
cargo run -- "Hello. How tall is the Empire State Building?"
```
